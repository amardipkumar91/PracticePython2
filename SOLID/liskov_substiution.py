'''
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses\
      without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if a program is using a base class, \
        it should be able to work correctly with any derived class without causing unexpected behaviors or breaking the programâ€™s functionality.
