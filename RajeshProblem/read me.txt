1. We need to read resource section of json which is under nft ver flder and update only resource section of json which is under git ver folder.

2. Logic should be just to touch the "resources" section - overwrite all in git target from service config source, remove any in git target that aren't in source.

3. exclude "replicas" from nft ver, just check resources section only.

4. Don't hardcode like we have cpu ATM.
